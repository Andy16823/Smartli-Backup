# Smartli-Backup

"Smartli Backup" is a small software that allows for automatic data backups. With just a few clicks, you can ensure that important information is always protected. We understand that data loss can be a terrible experience, and that you don't want to waste time manually backing up your data. That's why we developed "Smartli Backup."

In "Smartli Backup," you can create multiple plans to backup different directories and files. Each of these plans has a "schedule" function that indicates when a new backup should be created. If a time period has elapsed, the backup is not automatically created; instead, a dialog box is opened that informs you that a new backup should be created. You then have the option to perform the update or not. Additionally, you can export individual update plans to have all updates in one place.
